## How Importing Works

When you click "Import" on an item:

1. The content data is fetched from Relics & Realms
2. It's mapped to the appropriate PF2e system data format
3. A copy is created in your import compendium
4. Optionally, a copy is also added to your world Items/Actors/Journals
5. If the item was previously imported, the existing copy is updated

Imported items are tracked by their Relics & Realms ID, so re-importing always updates rather than duplicates.

## PF2e-Specific Features

- **Traditions** — Spells import with arcane, divine, occult, and primal tradition associations
- **Traits** — Items import with their PF2e trait tags
- **Rarity** — Common, uncommon, rare, and unique rarity levels are preserved
- **Bulk** — Proper PF2e bulk values (L, 1, 2, etc.)
- **Weapon Groups** — Sword, axe, bow, etc. mapped to PF2e weapon groups

## Bundle Imports

Bundles (content packs) can be imported all at once. Each item in the bundle is imported individually to its appropriate location (Items, Actors, Journals, Scenes, or Playlists).

## Publishing Content

To publish your own homebrew content:

1. Visit [relicsandrealms.com/dashboard](https://relicsandrealms.com/dashboard)
